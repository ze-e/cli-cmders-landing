              DJ. Programming guru. Entrepeneur. Gardener. Calligrapher. Designer. Visionary. Adventurer. Pioneer. Explorer. These
              are some of the words I use to describe myself.

              After spirit-bombing my way through Practicum by Yandex, Terry's gone even further beyond to enter his latest story arch: 
              "programming guru." That's right. As my paradigm-shifting new App, Terry's Goat Blog clearly demonstrates, I'm about to make
              my mark in the world, as your next freelance UX designer! Kamehameha!

              Not a robot btw. Just a man looking out for a nice lady's best interests, looking for a nice, happy ending to a long and winding adventure. 
              Or rather, I'm going to make something that is about to have a happy ending. And to be clear, this isn't my job. It's not a job that any human would ever do.
